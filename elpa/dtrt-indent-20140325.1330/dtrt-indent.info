1 Introduction
**************

1.1 Motivation
==============

Today, open source is omnipresent and programmers will often find
themselves editing other people's code.  Different people prefer
different kinds of indentation - there are arguments for using 2 or 8
spaces per level (and anything in between) and for using "hard" or
"soft" tabs.

   This usually isn't a problem when viewing other people's code, but
when editing it you'll find that it is very annoying if your editor
settings don't match the ones used for creating the file in question.

   Here's an example: suppose you are editing a C file that was created
with 3 spaces per level but your `c-basic-offset' is set to 4.  You'll
end up with something like this:

int main()
{
   printf(``hello\n'');
    exit(10);
//  ^ indented at 4 spaces instead of 3
}

   That's where `dtrt-indent' comes in: when you open a file, it will
perform a quick analysis of the file's indentation and will make an
educated guess on the indentation offset and the tab setting used for
creating the file.  If the guess is deemed reliable, the appropriate
settings will be transparently adjusted; otherwise, they will be left
alone.

   `dtrt-indent' errs on the side of caution: if the settings can't be
determined with a fairly high reliability it won't touch them, leaving
you off no worse.  More often than not, however, it will be able to
make a reliable guess and so, in general, you should find editing
foreign files much more pleasurable than before.

1.2 Scope
=========

`dtrt-indent' analyzes and adjusts two related settings: the indentation
offset and `indent-tabs-mode'.

   The indentation offset is stored in a variable that depends on the
major mode.  The following major modes are supported:

Major Mode                    Indentation Offset Variable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
c-mode                        c-basic-offset
c++-mode                      c-basic-offset
java-mode                     c-basic-offset
jde-mode                      c-basic-offset
javascript-mode               c-basic-offset
objc-mode                     c-basic-offset
php-mode                      c-basic-offset
perl-mode                     perl-indent-level
ruby-mode                     ruby-indent-level
ada-mode                      ada-indent
sh-mode                       sh-basic-offset
pascal-mode                   pascal-indent-level

   Note that python-mode is not included in this list because it already
comes with indentation offset guessing.

   `indent-tabs-mode' governs whether indentation uses "hard" tabs
(ASCII 9) or space characters only and is independent of the major mode.

1.3 Limitations
===============

`dtrt-indent' currently cannot guess the indentation style; for
instance, in Emacs C code can be formatted with a number of different
styles such as `k&r', `stroustrup' or `ellemtel'.  The effects of this
setting goes beyond just the indentation offset; `dtrt-indent'
currently isn't capable of detecting and adjusting this setting.

   Also, when a file uses hard tabs `dtrt-indent' currently won't make
an attempt to figure out how many spaces per tab were used for creating
the file or whether irregular tab stops were used.

2 Usage
*******

2.1 Basic Usage
===============

`dtrt-indent' is a minor mode and can be used in two ways:

   The recommended usage is to enable it globally by putting the
following in your `.emacs':

(require 'dtrt-indent)
(dtrt-indent-mode 1)

   When enabled globally, every visited file that satisfies the
conditions outlined in the chapter on heuristics (*Note Heuristics::.)
will be analyzed and its settings adjusted if necessary.  Remember that
dtrt-indent's default settings are conservative so enabling it globally
should be safe.  (There are also facilities for informing you when
settings are changed, and for undoing any changes in case of a wrong
guess.)

   If you don't trust dtrt-indent or generally dislike things happening
behind your back, however, you might want to leave it disabled by
default and only enable it when you notice that the file you're about
to edit requires adjustment.  In this case, put the following in your
`.emacs':

(require 'dtrt-indent)

   Then, to attempt adjustment of the currently visited file, do

M-x dtrt-indent-mode

   Note that by enabling dtrt-indent only selectively, you will lose a
lot of its utility.  It is strongly recommended that you enable it
globally and tweak its settings, if necessary, should it not perform as
well as you'd like.

2.2 Undoing wrong guesses
=========================

Normally, dtrt-indent will do its job in the background without you
having to do anything.  You should only have to intervene if it makes
bad decisions; this should happen only rarely.  When it does happen,
you can use `M-x dtrt-indent-undo' - this will revert any settings that
have been changed back to what they were before.

   Should `dtrt-indent' guess wrong, you can also consider fine-tuning
it as described in the chapter on configuration.  *Note Configuration::.

2.3 Excluding certain files
===========================

Usually, dtrt-indent should do the right thing for all files by
default, however you may want to keep it from touching the settings for
specific files.

   As explained in the chapter on heuristics (*Note: Heuristics::.),
there are several ways in which you can achieve this:

   * By including the File Variable `dtrt-indent-mode: 0', dtrt-indent
     will be disabled for that file.  Note that this is the standard
     way of disabling a minor mode for a given file.

   * If you include a File Variable for the indentation offset (variable
     name depends on major mode) and/or for `indent-tabs-mode',
     dtrt-indent mode won't override the setting in question.

   * You can set `dtrt-indent-accept-file-function' to a function
     returning `nil' for the file in question.  Your function might
     reject the file purely based on its file name or path, it could
     take a closer look at the file contents before making a choice, or
     it could consult some external data source.

3 Heuristics
************

This chapter describes the inner workings of dtrt-indent and how it
arrives at a conclusion on whether or not to change the indentation
settings, and to which value.

   If you find the information in this chapter confusing, see the
chapter on diagnosis (*Note: Diagnosis::.) to learn how to get a more
hands-on understanding of the process.

3.1 Files Analyzed
==================

`dtrt-indent' will analyze and potentially adjust settings only for
files that meet all of the following conditions:

   * When visiting the file, Emacs uses one of the supported major
     modes.  For example, files that are opened using
     "fundamental-mode" will be ignored because dtrt-indent doesn't
     know how to analyze them.

   * The file doesn't set the indentation offset variable corresponding
     to the major mode as a File Variable.  (If it does, that's a good
     indication that no guesswork is required.)

   * The file doesn't specify `dtrt-indent-mode: 0' as a File Variable.
     (If it does, it tells dtrt-indent that its services are not
     desired for this file.)

   * `dtrt-indent-accept-file-function' doesn't return nil for the
     file's name.  (By default, it will accept all files, but you might
     want to set it to ignore certain files.)


3.1.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-accept-file-function', `dtrt-indent-mode' (if set as a
File Variable)

3.2 Lines Analyzed
==================

In order to limit performance degradation due to the analysis, only a
fixed number of lines will be analyzed.  If the size of the file is
less than this number of lines, the whole file will be analyzed;
otherwise, the given number of lines at the beginning of the file are
analyzed.

   Certain lines are ignored during analysis:

   * Empty lines.

   * Lines that are not indented (indentation offset 0).

   * Lines that are the continuation of a multi-line comment or a
     multi-line statement or expression.

   * Lines that only contain a single character can be ignored; by
     default, however, they are included.


   If, after ignoring any lines that are not eligible, the amount of
relevant lines is smaller than a given threshold then the file is
treated as not fit for analysis and no guess will be made.

3.2.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-min-relevant-lines', `dtrt-indent-max-relevant-lines',
`dtrt-indent-ignore-single-chars-flag'

3.3 Histogram Generation
========================

For the remaining lines - those eligible within the fixed range - a
histogram is generated.  The histogram informs `dtrt-indent' about how
many lines are indented with one space, how many with two spaces, how
many with three spaces, etc.

3.4 Offset Assessment
=====================

Using the histogram, `dtrt-indent' determines for each of the potential
indentation offsets (by default, 2 through 8) how many lines are
indented with a multiple of that offset.

   Offsets for which the histogram doesn't contain enough distinct
indentations might be ignored; by default, however, a single
indentation per offset is accepted.

   After this step, dtrt-indent has a map of probabilities for each of
the potential offsets.

3.4.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-min-offset', `dtrt-indent-max-offset',
`dtrt-indent-min-matching-indentations'

3.5 Offset Merging
==================

As a next step, offsets that are a factor of another offset with
similar probability are discarded; this is necessary because in a file
that has been indented with, say, 4 spaces per level, 2 spaces per
level could otherwise be wrongly guessed.

3.5.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-max-merge-deviation'

3.6 Final Evaluation
====================

Finally, `dtrt-indent' looks at the highest probability of all
potential offsets; if that probablity is below a given threshold, the
guess is deemed unreliable and no settings are changed.

   Otherwise, as an additional sanity check, `dtrt-indent' will compare
the highest probability to the second-highest probability; if it is not
significantly higher, it will be deemed unreliable as well.

   If the analysis yielded a best guess that exceeds the absolute
threshold and the relative threshold when compared to the second-best
guess, that guess is deemed reliable and the indentation setting will
be modified.

3.6.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-min-quality', `dtrt-indent-min-indent-superiority'

3.7 `indent-tabs-mode' Setting
==============================

For determining hard vs. soft tabs, `dtrt-indent' counts the number of
lines out of the eligible lines in the fixed segment that are indented
using hard tabs, and the number of lines indented using spaces.  If
either count is significantly higher than the other count,
`indent-tabs-mode' will be modified.

3.7.1 Configuration settings used at this stage
-----------------------------------------------

`dtrt-indent-min-soft-tab-superiority',
`dtrt-indent-min-hard-tab-superiority'

4 Diagnosis
***********

The previous chapter described the inner workings of dtrt-indent (*Note
Heuristics::.)  It is good to know what it's doing, but it is even
better to be able to see how it arrives at a particular conclusion.
That's exactly what `dtrt-indent-diagnosis' provides: call `M-x
dtrt-indent-diagnosis' while visiting the buffer whose analysis you
wish to scrutinize.

   This will dump a diagnostic trace to the buffer
`*dtrt-indent-debug*'.  The trace should be self-explanatory, assuming
that you've read the chapter on Heuritics.  (*Note Heuristics::.)
Reading and understanding the trace should go a long way toward giving
you an idea of which parameters need fine-tuning, if any.

4.1 Eligible Line Highlighting
==============================

When reading the trace produced by `M-x dtrt-indent-diagnosis' you
might spot an entry in the histogram and wonder "Why would dtrt-indent
count these lines toward the histogram?".  It is possible that you
found a bug in the way dtrt-indent determines which lines to include in
the histogram.  To make sure, you can use `M-x dtrt-indent-highlight'
while visiting the buffer whose analysis appears out of whack.  This
will highlight any indentation that's been used to calculate the
histogram and allows you to doublecheck whether or not you found a
situation that could be improved.

   Note that if you did find a situation where dtrt-indent's heuristics
leaves a lot to be desired, tweaking its parameters won't help; most
likely, `dtrt-indent-language-syntax-table' would need to be amended.

5 Configuration
***************

dtrt-indent's configuration can be tweaked using the standard Emacs
customization facility; all settings can be found in the customization
group called "dtrt-indent" which is a member of both the "files" and
"convenience" groups.

   All settings come with detailed inline documentation; therefore, this
chapter aims to only give you a general overview of the available
settings.

   There are two settings that govern dtrt-indent's basic behaviour; all
other parameters should be considered as fine-tuning and should only be
tweaked after reading the chapters on heuristics (*Note: Heuristics::.)
and diagnosis (*Note: Diagnosis::.)

   The two basic settings are `dtrt-indent-verbosity' which determines
how eloquent dtrt-indent is in telling you about what it's doing, and
`dtrt-indent-require-confirmation-flag' which determines whether or not
your consent is required for any change.

   The remaining settings are meant for fine-tuning the heuristics:

   * `dtrt-indent-min-relevant-lines' determines the minimum number of
     non-empty, indented, eligible lines that are required for
     dtrt-indent to attempt a guess

   * `dtrt-indent-min-relevant-lines' gives the maximum number of lines
     dtrt-indent will analyze, setting an upper bound on the amount of
     time the analysis consumes

   * `dtrt-indent-min-quality' and `dtrt-indent-min-indent-superiority'
     are the primary variables determining how conservative dtrt-indent
     is in accepting a guess of indentation offset

   * `dtrt-indent-min-soft-tab-superiority' and
     `dtrt-indent-min-hard-tab-superiority' determine how conservative
     dtrt-indent is in accepting a guess of the `indent-tabs-mode'
     setting.

   * `dtrt-indent-max-merge-deviation' indicates the threshold beyond
     which an offset is treated as a sub-offset of a larger offset with
     similar probability

   * `dtrt-indent-ignore-single-chars-flag' tells dtrt-indent whether
     or not to analyze lines containing only a single character

   * `dtrt-indent-min-matching-indentations' is a secondary variable to
     avoid false positives

   * `dtrt-indent-min-offset' and `dtrt-indent-max-offset' give the
     smallest and largest indentation offsets that can be guessed, and
     should normally not be tinkered with

   * `dtrt-indent-accept-file-function' can be used to exclude certain
     files from analysis based on their path
